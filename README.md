# P5-Snake-Game

# Game Description
This is a basic p5 snake game with sound effects and arduino uno components to provide the sense of lives remaing.

# How to play 
1) To start playing use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the snake. Prevent the snake from hitting the edges and itself while collecting points that are scattered around the game. 
2) Each game you are provided 3 lives. The three lives are represented using the slider at the bottom of the game and the LED on the arduino board. After you die move the slider down one notch and the LED wil get darker. Once the LED is out you are fully elimanted from the game.
3) Once you are eliminated add upp the 3 scores from each life and that is your total score.

# Taking Scores
The score will be displayed at the top left of the game. After each round when you die, record that score. At the end of the game when you have used up all your lives, add up all hreee scores from each life and that is your final score. 

# Possible Future Development
 1) Implementing a version where the snake gets faster each time you collect a point.
 2) create a multiplayer mode where you compete for points and after a time limit the snake with the most amounf of points win.
 3) Creating multiple game screens (Ex. Start Screen)
 4) Create customizable snakes
